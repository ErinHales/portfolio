                <p>Ozzy is a parenting application designed to help parents and care providers connect and communicate. It was
                    designed as a personal project during my time at Dev Mountain. It is one of my larger projects and won
                    the award for "Best Overall App".</p>

                <p>This is a calendar application also built during Dev Mountain. It was a very technical piece. Because of
                    the way we measure time, I had to create a lot of algorithms to display the dates correctly and to make
                    events show up in the right spot.</p>

                <p>This weather app was built as part of the Free Code Camp curriculum. I built it on my own after 2 months
                    of studying code in my free time. It uses the Open Weather API and gives the current weather as well
                    as a three day forecast.</p>

                <p>I never expected to be a web developer. It's not that I had any bias against it, but rather that it was never
                    an option. I simply didn't know about it. It wasn't until 2017 that I had a discussion with an old friend
                    who is now a web developer. This encouraged me to look into the field. What I found was that I loved
                    it! It satisfied my itch for problem solving and also design. I found that hours spent in front of the
                    computer passed quickly.</p>
                <p>When I decided to go to Dev Mountain (a three month intensive program), I knew that it was going to be a
                    really hard thing, so I spent months preparing. Every day when I got home from work, I would spend 3-4
                    hours going through courses on Free Code Camp and building small projects. I learned that I was good
                    at coding too. I finished assignments in half the time recommended, and I was quick at catching on to
                    new topics.</p>
                <p>When I got to Dev Mountain, although my preparation had put me ahead, it didn't make it easy. We learned
                    so much in such a short amount of time. It paid off when we presented on our personal projects and I
                    won 'Best Overall' award on my parenting app, Ozzy.</p>
